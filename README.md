#These notes are for the Econ 493 course at the University of Alberta, taught by Professor Sebastian Fossati. The Econ 385 notes are from the course taught by Professor Max Sties, designed for the Canadian Governor Challenge. While the University of Alberta won, I was not on the team.

#The course is based on “Forecasting: Principles and Practice,” 2nd edition, and additional PowerPoint materials by Professor Sebastian Fossati. 
You can find the 3rd edition of the book here.

#I am still learning how to use GitHub...
