#the tip
  #i wantto have the same bersion of hte software as my student
  #bUT I DO'T WANT AN UPDATE TO break anything
  # do not update anything until you are down.

#An object's name represet tthe information store in that object, so you can treat the obect's name as it it were the vaule stored inside

#An vestoryt is seris of elements such as numbers, you can cereate a vector and store it as an obejct in the same way. 
#the function can do the al the timne.


# we ofthen work with. dat that are cartegorical, to created a vector of rtest - strings in programming term
  #we must place the txt in quotes
  #string vecotr

#categrica data can aso bes stored as a factor, which has a underlying nunmberic
  #presentation, model witll convert factors to dummies
  #factor? 

#the same priples can be used tp. create more complex obejct like matrices, arrys lists and daterframe
#most data sets you will work with will be road into R and stored as dataframe
# so this course will mainly focus on ,mainpulating and visulaizing these objets. 

#The the same priciple  can be used to create more complsx tobjects lie matrix, arrys list anda datafreamas
#most data sets you will work with will be read into and stored as data frame so this cource will ianly foucisng

#so, other wat of rreathing obejctive, you have a lot of tip for creatinga lot of thing, 

# you need to save it. 

#save(The class note, file = "wulala gei")
# this thing need to using the save the enviroment it can help on saivng both the script.
